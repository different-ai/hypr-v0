With a newcomers perspective, could a self-hosting text channel for this application be created in the discord group? A comprehensive discussion board and potential support group with close ties to the curators of this application: would benefit a community using this application, draw more potential use-case from new users feeling supported, and keep visibility of Fo2k and Different AI by encouraging folks to coming to a sanctioned resource. Would imagine it would also draw some of the recurring and irrelevant questions out of other threads. Having to go between Github, Reddit, and other sources for guidance that would benefit from having a dedicated channel  That said, am encountering similar issues that self-hosting instructions are not up-to-date as the code structure seems to have changed since the Github update and Llaama 3.2. Will there be a revisitation of the instructions to correct for accuracy in the matter?",
