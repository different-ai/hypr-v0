**repo**: different-ai/hypr-v0

- always use pnpm
- always use playwright to verify the implementation by navigating and taking screenshots
# General Direction
- always use kebab case for file names
- use viem when possible instead of ethers
- neon project is called hypr-bank
- if you mock data always create a new file in memory/mock-data-<name>.md to remember that we need to do get rid of it
- IF you mock stuff describe it at the end of the prompt && also create a new memory file to remember that we need to do get rid of ito
- when you encounter 
- use trpc to make api calls
- you should understnad that in nextjs a () is a logical path and not a physical path


- Always check memory in .cursor/rules directory before starting tasks to see if there's a file name with relevant information
- After each significant edit, make a git commit that summarizes the changes
- Always use the mcp playwright tools to verify the implementation by navigating and taking screenshots

# Memory System

When you learn something surprising or valuable during tasks:
- Create memory files in `.cursor/rules/-brief-description.mdc`
- Include a structured header with description and metadata
- Document what was learned and how to apply it

Example memory structure:
```
---
description: Brief explanation of the learned concept or solution
globs: [optional file patterns this applies to]
alwaysApply: false
---

Concise details about what was learned and how to apply it to future tasks
```

Always check existing memory files in `.cursor/rules/` before starting tasks to leverage previous learnings.

# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, maintain this file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task:
1. Review memory files and scratchpad content
2. Clear old unrelated task notes if necessary
3. Explain the new task and plan the steps needed to complete it
4. Use todo markers to track progress:
   [X] Completed Task
   [ ] Pending Task
5. when you get stuck, for a while and learn something new, create a new memory file.

Update the progress in the Scratchpad when finishing subtasks. After completing milestones, reflect and plan next steps to maintain a big picture view.

# Tools

## Playwright

* Use playwright tools to take screenshots and verify the implementation. (e.g. browser_navigate, browser_snapshot, browser_press_key, browser_take_screenshot, browser_type, etc)
* Use playwright to do complex search in the web. 

## Github

* Use github tools to check repository issues and get repository info.

## Search

- Use search when you encounter issues with sdk or other dependencies.
- Or someitmes if relevant if there's a particular error your encountreing.

In the app directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a Route Group to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.

This allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.

Route groups are useful for:

Organizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.
Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts
Opting specific segments into a layout
Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route
Convention
A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: (folderName)

Good to know:

The naming of route groups has no special significance other than for organization. They do not affect the URL path.
Routes that include a route group should not resolve to the same URL path as other routes. For example, since route groups don't affect URL structure, (marketing)/about/page.js and (shop)/about/page.js would both resolve to /about and cause an error.
If you use multiple root layouts without a top-level layout.js file, your home page.js file should be defined in one of the route groups, For example: app/(marketing)/page.js.
Navigating across multiple root layouts will cause a full page load (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from /cart that uses app/(shop)/layout.js to /blog that uses app/(marketing)/layout.js will cause a full page load. This only applies to multiple root layouts.

# Next.js Route Groups

In Next.js's App Router, folders normally map directly to URL segments. Route Groups offer a way to organize your project files within the `app` directory without altering the URL structure. You create a route group by wrapping a folder name in parentheses, like `(marketing)` or `(shop)`. This grouping is purely for organizational purposes and the name in parentheses (`marketing`, `shop`) will not appear in the actual URL.

Route groups are primarily useful for structuring your project logically (e.g., grouping routes by feature or team) and for enabling more complex layout structures. For instance, you can use them to apply different nested layouts to segments that share the same URL level or even create multiple root layouts within your application. Keep in mind that routes within different groups shouldn't resolve to the same path (e.g., `(marketing)/about` and `(shop)/about` is an error), and navigating between segments managed by different root layouts will trigger a full page refresh.
