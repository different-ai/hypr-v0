repo: different-ai/hypr-v0

- always use pnpm
- always use playwright to verify the implementation by navigating and taking screenshots
# General Direction
- always use kebab case for file names
- use viem when possible instead of ethers
- neon project is called hypr-bank
- if you mock data always create a new file in memory/mock-data-<name>.md to remember that we need to do get rid of it
- IF you mock stuff describe it at the end of the prompt && also create a new memory file to remember that we need to do get rid of ito
- when you encounter 


- Always check memory in .cursor/rules directory before starting tasks to see if there's a file name with relevant information
- After each significant edit, make a git commit that summarizes the changes
- Always use the mcp playwright tools to verify the implementation by navigating and taking screenshots

# Memory System

When you learn something surprising or valuable during tasks:
- Create memory files in `.cursor/rules/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.mdc`
- Include a structured header with description and metadata
- Document what was learned and how to apply it

Example memory structure:
```
---
description: Brief explanation of the learned concept or solution
globs: [optional file patterns this applies to]
alwaysApply: false
---

Concise details about what was learned and how to apply it to future tasks
```

Always check existing memory files in `.cursor/rules/` before starting tasks to leverage previous learnings.

# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, maintain this file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task:
1. Review memory files and scratchpad content
2. Clear old unrelated task notes if necessary
3. Explain the new task and plan the steps needed to complete it
4. Use todo markers to track progress:
   [X] Completed Task
   [ ] Pending Task
5. when you get stuck, for a while and learn something new, create a new memory file.

Update the progress in the Scratchpad when finishing subtasks. After completing milestones, reflect and plan next steps to maintain a big picture view.

# Tools

## Playwright

* Use playwright tools to take screenshots and verify the implementation. (e.g. browser_navigate, browser_snapshot, browser_press_key, browser_take_screenshot, browser_type, etc)
* Use playwright to do complex search in the web. 

## Github

* Use github tools to check repository issues and get repository info.

## Search

- Use search when you encounter issues with sdk or other dependencies.
- Or someitmes if relevant if there's a particular error your encountreing.
