## Philosophy

hyprsqrl is built on three core principles:

1. **Integration-First**: We plug into your existing payments, invoicing, and accounting stacks‚Äîno need to abandon your favorite tools!
2. **Human-in-the-loop**: Our AI "watches" for tasks and queues them in a Financial Inbox‚Äîa single place where you confirm or tweak details before anything final happens.
3. **Eventually invisible software**: If we do our job well, you‚Äôll spend less and less time actively managing your financial tools‚Äîand more time focusing on your business.
