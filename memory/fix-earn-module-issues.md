# Earn Module Implementation Issues and Solutions

## Current Status

The Earn module has been implemented with a full-page design rather than modals:
- Route structure follows `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/earn/`
- Stepper for onboarding
- Dashboard for active users
- Settings page for allocation adjustment

## Remaining Issues

There are some TypeScript/linter errors that might need to be addressed:

1. **Import errors in Stepper.tsx**:
   - Cannot find module errors for `@/components/earn/*` components
   - These files exist but TypeScript may not recognize them

2. **Import errors in page.tsx**:
   - Cannot find module errors for utility components and hooks
   - Files exist but TypeScript may not recognize them

## Resolution Steps

1. **Restart TypeScript Server**:
   - In VSCode: Cmd+Shift+P â†’ "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
   - This often resolves path alias resolution issues

2. **Restart Dev Server**:
   - Stop and restart your Next.js dev server
   - This can help with file watching and refreshing module resolution

3. **Update tsconfig.json**:
   - Ensure path aliases are correctly configured
   - Make sure module resolution is set up properly

4. **Clear Build Cache**:
   - Run `pnpm clean` or equivalent to clear build caches
   - Rebuild the project with `pnpm build`

5. **Verify Component Props**:
   - `ConfirmCard.tsx` now has `allocation?: number` as an optional prop with default value
   - Ensure `Stepper.tsx` passes this prop correctly

## Testing Notes

- Test the entire flow from enabling to dashboard
- Verify allocation slider works correctly
- Check that settings page properly persists changes

## Styling Notes

The implementation follows a card-based design with:
- Primary color used for buttons and highlights
- Green color for confirmation actions
- White/gray for backgrounds with proper dark mode support
- Rounded corners and shadow effects for depth
